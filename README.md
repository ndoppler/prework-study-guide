# Pre-Work Study Guide Page

## Description

The purpose was to build a website using various coding languages to gather a familiarity with each and how they work together. The motivation is to become a better coder through practice and repetition. I learned how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together to build a website and how to use Git to version control this project.
